## Custom Components

### Triplet Generator

The Triplet Generator is a custom component responsible for generating triplets of images for the training of the face recognition model. These triplets consist of an anchor image, a positive image (same identity as the anchor), and a negative image (different identity from the anchor). The dataset use was from microsoft's 1M face dataset [72 per face dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/DigiFace1M/tree/main). You can use `utils/tf_record_reader` to inspect generated artifacts.

### Embedding Generator

The Embedding Generator is a custom component that takes the triplets generated by the Triplet Generator and produces face embeddings using mobile_net. These embeddings represent the unique features of each face and serve as the input for training the face recognition model.

### Trainer

The Trainer is a custom component responsible for training the face recognition model using the generated embeddings. It leverages TensorFlow to create and train the model, utilizing the triplet loss function to optimize the model for accurate face recognition.

## Interactive Runs

The interactive runs of the TFX pipeline are recorded in a Jupyter notebook, providing a detailed overview of the pipeline's execution. The notebook captures key parameters, metrics, and visualizations for each run.

### Recorded Information

1. **Note:** The accuracy of the pipeline run is worse than model from initial analysis. This was theorized due to the float16 quantization in the input metric in EmbeddingGen component.
