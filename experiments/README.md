## MLflow Experiments

The experiments conducted on face recognition encoding are recorded in the MLflow server from DagHub. Each experiment captures key information such as parameters, metrics, and artifacts. [MLFlow server link](https://dagshub.com/yeyintaung.ya276/FaceRecognization/experiments/)

### Recorded Information

1. **Parameters:** Outline the parameters used in the experiments, including encoding configurations, model architecture details, learning rate, and batch size.
2. **Metrics:** Highlight key metrics recorded during the experiments, such as accuracy, Anchor-Negative distance, Anchor-Positive distance.
3. **Artifacts:** Specify any artifacts generated during the experiments, such as model checkpoints, visualizations.


## Summary

Float16 quantization is explored as a potential factor impacting the accuracy of the model. This section investigates the use of 16-bit floating-point representation and its effects on model performance.


## Running Experiments

The detail of running experiment can be found in respective notebook.
